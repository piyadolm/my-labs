# Introduction

When you analyze your cloud-based solutions, you should be asking yourself a series of questions that will help you determine whether your applications are following operational best practices.

For example:

* How operationally mature is your cloud environment?
* Are you incorporating modern practices such as DevOps into the way your organization operates?
* Are you able to assess the health of your infrastructure?
* Are adverse events visible and actionable?
* Are you provisioning resources manually, or have you automated them to reduce risk and increase efficiency?

In this module, you'll learn about the Operational Excellence pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which will enable you to answer these types of questions and improve the operations of your Azure cloud deployments.
