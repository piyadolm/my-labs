# Computer Vision models and capabilities

Task | Description
---- | ---------
Image classification | Training a ML model to classify images based on their contents.
Object detection | Object detection ML models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box.
Semantic segmentation | Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong.
Image analysis | You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
Face detection, analysis, and recognition | A specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image.
Optical character recognition (OCR) | A technique used to detect and read text in images.
