# Create compute resources

After you have created an workspace, **you need compute on which to run the training process**.

## Create compute targets

Compute targets are cloud-based resources on which you can run model training and data exploration processes.

1. In **Azure Machine Learning studio**, view the **Compute** page. There are 4 kinds of compute resource you can create:

    * **Compute Instances:** **Development workstations** that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
    * **Compute Clusters:** **Scalable clusters** of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
    * **Inference Clusters:** Deployment targets **for predictive services** that use your trained models.
    * **Attached Compute:** Links to **existing Azure compute resources**, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

2. On **Compute Instances** tab, add a new compute instance.
3. While the compute instance is being created, switch to the Compute Clusters tab, and add a new compute cluster.
